# W-Alliteration Extending Through Both Half-Lines in Beowulf

Inspired by line 17 — **wuldres wealdend woroldáre forgeaf** — where three w-words
roll across the caesura creating a rhyme-like effect, this survey catalogues lines
where w-alliteration spans both half-lines with particular sonic resonance.

## Near-Rhyme Between W-Words

Lines where the w-words don't just alliterate but actively rhyme or echo each other.

### Line 931: wunder æfter wundre · wuldres hyrde
*"wonder after wonder, glory's Keeper"*

Three w-words that are practically rhyming: **wunder/wundre/wuldres**. The closest
match to line 17's sonic texture.

### Line 289: worda ond worca · sé þe wél þenceð
*"between words and works, he who reasons rightly"*

**worda/worca** is a near-perfect rhyme, then **wél** carries the sound across the
caesura.

### Line 1100: wordum né worcum · waére ne braéce
*"by word nor by deed would not break the treaty"*

Same **wordum/worcum** pair as 289, with **waére** picking it up in the second half.

### Line 1833: weordum ond worcum · þæt ic þé wél herige
*"with words and with deeds, so that I might honour you rightly"*

The third appearance of the worda/worca formula, again resolved with **wél**.

### Line 3030: wyrda né worda · Weorod eall árás
*"in deeds or in words. The troop all arose"*

**wyrda/worda** — another gorgeous near-rhyme, and **Weorod** seals it with a third w.

### Line 17: wuldres wealdend · woroldáre forgeaf
*"Ruler of Glory, granted honour on earth"*

The original inspiration. **wuldres/wealdend/woroldáre** — the -ld- cluster echoes
through all three words.

### Line 1752: wuldres waldend · weorðmynda daél
*"glory's Ruler, a share of honour"*

Near-twin of line 17. Same **wuldres/waldend** formula, with **weorðmynda** extending
across the break. The poet reuses the epithet but varies the second half.

### Line 183: wuldres waldend · Wá bið þaém ðe sceal
*"Glory's Wielder. Woe be to him who must"*

A third instance of **wuldres waldend**, this time snapped into a grim warning with
**Wá**.

## Four W-Words Spanning Both Halves

Lines where the poet hammers out four or more w-words across the full line.

### Line 319: wið wráð werod · wearde healdan
*"against brutal dacoits keep watch"*

Four w's like a war drum: **wið/wráð/werod/wearde**. The -eard- echo between werod
and wearde binds the halves.

### Line 660: waca wið wráþum · ne bið þé wilna gád
*"keep watch against the enemy; there shall be no dearth of your desires"*

**waca/wið/wráþum/wilna** — vigilance and desire framed in four w's.

### Line 516: wéol wintrys wylm · git on wæteres aéht
*"welled, in winter's swells; you in the water's grasp"*

Four w's with churning assonance in **wéol/wylm/wæteres**. The sea itself working
through the consonants.

### Line 1132: won wið winde · winter ýþe beléac
*"fought against the wind; the winter locked the waves"*

**won/wið/winde/winter** — elemental fury compressed into four w-words.

### Line 612: word waéron wynsume · Éode Wealhþéow forð
*"words were joyful. Wealhtheow came forth"*

**word/waéron/wynsume/Wealhþéow** — the queen's name becomes part of the
alliterative weave.

### Line 2316: wæs þæs wyrmes wíg · wíde gesýne
*"the war-strength of that wyrm was widely seen"*

**wyrmes/wíg/wíde** (plus **wæs**) — the sibilant hiss of the wyrm lives in the
w-sounds.

### Line 1559: wigena weorðmynd · þæt wæs waépna cyst
*"an honour of warriors, it was the choicest weapon"*

**wigena/weorðmynd/wæs/waépna** — four w's binding warrior to weapon.

### Line 1607: wígbil wanian · þæt wæs wundra sum
*"the war-bill to wane; that was a great wonder"*

**wígbil/wanian/wæs/wundra** — the melting sword described in four w-words.

### Line 2913: wíde weorðeð · wæs sío wróht scepen
*"widely becomes; the quarrel was shaped"*

**wíde/weorðeð/wæs/wróht** — four w's framing the inevitability of conflict.

### Line 2923: wihte ne wéne · ac wæs wíde cúð
*"expect a bit, but it was widely known"*

**wihte/wéne/wæs/wíde** — four w's carrying an ironic understatement.

### Line 734: wistfylle wén · Ne wæs þæt wyrd þá gén
*"a hope of a full feast. It was not his fate again"*

**wistfylle/wén/wæs/wyrd** — hope and fate yoked together, Grendel's appetite
denied.

### Line 2014: weorod wæs on wynne · ne seah ic wídan feorh
*"The troop was joyful; I have not seen in my whole life"*

**weorod/wæs/wynne/wídan** — joy spreading wide.

## Triple W-Words With Atmospheric Power

Lines where three w-words create a particular mood or landscape.

### Line 1358: warigeað wulfhleoþu · windige næssas
*"inhabited, wolf-slopes, windy water-capes"*

**warigeað/wulfhleoþu/windige** — wild, windswept, wolfish. One of the most
evocative lines in the entire poem. The landscape itself seems to howl.

### Line 546: wado weallende · wedera cealdost
*"the water welling, the coldest of weathers"*

**wado/weallende/wedera** — the sea speaking through w-sounds. The -ea- vowels bind
the half-lines.

### Line 1416: wynléasne wudu · wæter under stód
*"the joyless forest; water stood below"*

**wynléasne/wudu/wæter** — bleak landscape in three w-words. Grendel's mere.

**wínsele/wéstne/windge** — desolation distilled. The wind through the ruined hall.

### Line 1364: wudu wyrtum fæst · wæter oferhelmað
*"tree held fast by its roots overshadows the water"*

**wudu/wyrtum/wæter** — earthy and watery, the -u- vowels binding them. Still
describing the mere.

### Line 572: windige weallas · Wyrd oft nereð

**windige/weallas/Wyrd** — elemental, then philosophical.

### Line 8: wéox under wolcnum · weorðmyndum þáh
*"he waxed under the clouds, throve in honours"*

**wéox/wolcnum/weorðmyndum** — just nine lines before line 17. The Prologue is
saturated with w-alliteration.

### Line 1374: won tó wolcnum · þonne wind styreþ
*"dark to the clouds, when the wind stirs"*

**won/wolcnum/wind** — darkness and weather bound in w-sounds. Another mere-passage
line.

*"gloriously bright weathers. Then winter was gone"*

**wuldortorhtan/weder/wæs/winter** — the relief of spring after the Finnsburg
episode. One of the few w-saturated lines that feels warm.

### Line 93: wlitebeorhtne wang · swá wæter bebúgeð
*"that fair, sublime field bounded by water"*

**wlitebeorhtne/wang/wæter** — beauty described in w-sounds. The w+consonant cluster
opening (wl-) is distinctive.

### Line 1400: wicg wundenfeax · wísa fengel
*"a mount with braided mane; the wise ruler"*

**wicg/wundenfeax/wísa** — horse and ruler linked by alliteration.

### Line 1650: wliteséon wraétlíc · weras onsáwon

### Line 714: wód under wolcnum · tó þæs þe hé wínreced
*"he waded under the clouds until he the wine-hall"*

**wód/wolcnum/wínreced** — Grendel approaching Heorot. The menace in the movement.

### Line 651: wan under wolcnum · Werod eall árás
*"black beneath the skies. The troop all arose"*

**wan/wolcnum/Werod** — darkness falling, the company rising.

### Line 702: weold wídeferhð · Cóm on wanre niht
*"has ruled forever. In the colourless night came"*

**weold/wídeferhð/wanre** — God's eternal rule set against the colourless night.

### Line 1770: wéold under wolcnum · ond hig wigge beléac

battle.

### Line 1489: wraétlíc waégsweord · wídcúðne man
*"the glorious wave-sword, the widely-known man"*

**wraétlíc/waégsweord/wídcúðne** — weapon and warrior in three compound w-words.

### Line 1452: worhte waépna smið · wundrum téode
*"was wrought by weapons' smith, wonderfully lengthened"*

**worhte/waépna/wundrum** — craft and wonder.

## Recurring Formulae

The poet returns to certain w-alliterative patterns:

- **wuldres wealdend/waldend** appears at lines 17, 183, and 1752 — always a
  formulaic epithet for God, always generating triple-w lines.
- **worda/wordum + worca/worcum** appears at 289, 1100, and 1833 — a stock pairing
  of "words and works" that naturally produces cross-caesura w-alliteration.
- **wolcnum** ("clouds") is a w-magnet, appearing in w-heavy lines at 8, 651, 702,
  714, 1119, 1374, 1631, and 1770. The poet seems drawn to setting scenes "under
  wolcnum" when building w-alliterative momentum.
- **wyrd** ("fate") frequently anchors the second half of w-alliterative lines
  (455, 477, 572, 734, 1205, 2420, 2526, 2574, 2814), pulling the alliteration
  across the break with thematic gravity.
